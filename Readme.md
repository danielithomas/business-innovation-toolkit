# Business Innovation Toolkit

This is my business innovation toolkit: A collection of guides, tools, diagrams and
processes that can be utilised to help unlock new business models and
strategies to create value.

This collection will _never_ be complete, nor will be entirely comprehensive: New methods and new knowledge will continue to be created. This resource simply scratches the surface; but I hope that it can be useful to others as you go through your innovation journies.
