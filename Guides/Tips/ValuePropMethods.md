# Writing a Value Proposition Statement

Some Examples of how you can now take what you have in a value proposition canvas and summarise it into a concise and powerful statement. There are many other ways in which you can do this, but here are three: 

1.	Geoff Moore’s Value Positioning Statement (Moore 1999)

> For  ____________ (target customer)
> who ____________  (statement of the need or opportunity)
> our (product/service name) is  ____________  (product category)
> that (statement of benefit) ____________ .

Some versions of Moore & McKenna’s statement also add:

> Unlike ______________ (Relevant Competitor/s) 
> Our product provides _____________ (Unique point of differentiation)

2.	Steve Blank’s XYZ 

> We help [X] do [Y] doing [Z].

3.	Dave Mclure’s Elevator Ride: What, How, Why. Incorporating 3 simple keywords or phrases. Not a template per-se, but a way to simplify down your value statement:

> Example: "Mint.com is the free, easy way to manage your money online."
