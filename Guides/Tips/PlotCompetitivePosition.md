# Plotting Competitive Position

A Tip from _Disciplined Entrepreneurship_ (Aulet, 2013)

Problem-Solution Fit: Does your customer care?

One challenge for an entrepreneur solving a problem for a customer is **“so what?”** You need to understand the context in which your value proposition exists. This means looking at your competitors and the most dangerous competitor of all: Doing Nothing (also known as the customer’s “Status Quo”).

One technique that can help you identify if a product or service, pain reliever or gain creator is important is to create a competitive position chart (Aulet, 2013). This chart involves plotting the two highest priorities for the customer, then plotting your solution as a rating of how well you meet the customer's need in relation to these priorities. 

You do not need to have too fine a precision if you are roughly plotting. A rating of "low", "med", "high" or a score of 1 to 5 should be sufficient.

Then, plot your competitors and “doing nothing”. If competition is further to the top right of the chart than you are, you have work to do. Worse, if doing nothing is further to the right top corner than your products and services: You are in deep trouble.
